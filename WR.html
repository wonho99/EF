          What makes you rich? According to a Gallup poll done a few years ago, the public’s median definition of “rich” was either an income of $120,000 or assets of one million dollars.
          <br>By that definition, a lot of people could be considered rich. Roughly the top 7% of Americans have a net worth of a million dollars or more.
          <br>More recently, MSN Money asked their more money-savvy readers to define “rich.” A majority of the more than 11,000 who responded felt that they would need at least five million dollars to consider themselves rich.
          <br>While the average American thinks assets of a million dollars makes a person rich, someone who actually has that amount in assets understands this isn’t necessarily the case. Face it, a million bucks just isn’t what it used to be.
